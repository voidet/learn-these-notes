Welcome to Learn Notes. This app is your study buddy to learn the notes on your instrument. The app won't show you where they are. But this system is designed to help cement their locations in.

A quick bit about why? I've been "learning" guitar on and off for years. I found myself navigating around via patterns. For the most part these octave shapes worked well. But I couldn't really look at the fretboard and point "Here is a B". I would always have to work backwards from the 5th or 6th strings to find my way. Sound familiar?
